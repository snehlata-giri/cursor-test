      # Dgraph requires both zero and alpha nodes
      # For CI, we'll use a standalone Dgraph setup
      # Option 1: Skip Dgraph if tests don't strictly need it
      # Option 2: Use a simpler in-memory setup or mock
      # For now, we'll comment out Dgraph and tests should handle missing Dgraph gracefully
